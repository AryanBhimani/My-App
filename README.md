# MyApp - Dock with Draggable Icons

This Flutter application demonstrates a dock with draggable icons. Users can hover over the icons to scale them up and drag them to reorder within the dock. The dock items are displayed as a horizontal row of icons, and each icon has its own dynamic color and hover effect.

## Features
- **Draggable Icons**: Icons are draggable within the dock. Users can rearrange the order of icons by dragging and dropping them.
- **Hover Effect**: Icons scale up when hovered, providing a visual cue to the user.
- **Dynamic Colors**: Each icon's background color is dynamically determined based on its hash code, ensuring a variety of colors.
- **Drag Target**: A `DragTarget` is used to handle dropped items and reorder the icons within the dock.

## Components
### 1. `MyApp`
   - This is the main entry point of the app. It wraps the `Dock` widget inside a `Scaffold` and centers it within the screen.

### 2. `Dock<T>`
   - A custom widget that represents the dock containing draggable items.
   - Accepts a list of items (icons in this case) and a `builder` function that defines how each item is rendered and its hover state.

### 3. `_DockState<T>`
   - The state class for the `Dock` widget, responsible for managing the hover state and handling drag-and-drop actions.
   - Uses `GestureDetector` and `MouseRegion` to detect hover events and a `DragTarget` to allow items to be reordered.
